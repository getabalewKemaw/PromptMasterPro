# 📱 PromptMaster Pro - Mobile App Vision

## 🌟 Core Philosophy
**"Empowering Local Voices with Global AI"**
The app must feel native, fast, and magical. It shouldn't feel like a "translation tool" but like a "super-smart assistant that speaks your language."

---

## 🎨 Design Language (The "Premium" Look)
- **Theme**: Modern, clean, with subtle Ethiopian/African design accents (patterns or colors).
- **Typography**: High-readability fonts that support Ethiopic script (Amharic/Tigrinya) beautifully.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions between screens. No "janky" loading states.
- **Dark Mode**: Fully supported for night-time usage.

## 🚀 Key Features Breakdown

### 1. Onboarding (The Hook)
- **Language Selection**: First screen asks "What language do you speak?" (Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, English).
- **Quick Demo**: Show a 3-second animation of "Amharic Input -> AI Magic -> Amharic Output".

### 2. The "Create" Tab (Main Screen)
- **Simple Input**: Large text area.
- **"Magic Wand" Button**: The "Improve Prompt" feature. User types "Coffee", taps wand -> App suggests "Write a detailed history of Ethiopian Coffee ceremonies".
- **Language Toggle**: Quick switch between input/output languages.

### 3. The "Chat" Interface
- **Bubble Design**: Distinct colors for User (Right) and AI (Left).
- **Translation Toggle**: A small icon on every AI message to toggle between [Local Language] <-> [English].
- **Action Bar**: Copy, Share, Favorite, Regenerate.

### 4. Template Library
- **Card Layout**: Grid of cards with icons (e.g., 🎓 Education, 💼 Business).
- **Smart Forms**: Clicking a template opens a form, not just a text box.
  - *Example*: "Job Application" Template -> Asks for [Job Title], [Company Name], [Your Experience].

### 5. Profile & History
- **Searchable History**: "What was that poem I wrote last week?"
- **Favorites**: Quick access to best prompts.
- **Usage Stats**: "You have generated 50 prompts this week!"
